# HeartBeat: AI-Powered Heart Health Monitoring

## Berkeley AI Hackathon - Social Impact Track

### Project Overview

HeartBeat is an accessible heart health monitoring system that uses a combination of a microphone, stethoscope, and
optional blood pressure monitor to detect and classify heart conditions. By leveraging machine learning to analyze heart
sounds, we aim to create an affordable tool for early detection of heart abnormalities, particularly in underserved
communities with limited access to healthcare.
